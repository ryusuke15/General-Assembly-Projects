# Forum

## Problem

- Jake loves discussion amongst his friends, but he wants a way to keep it organized. He wants his own forum.

## Requirements

- Jake wants his friends to be able to discuss things by topics. Users should be able to create topics, and other users should be able to comment on those topics.
- Jake isn't concerned about sub-comments, for now.
- Jake also wants to be able to see what topics have the most comments.
- Jake thinks it would be cool if users could vote on topics, and have the topics displayed based on popularity.
- Jake is a nerd, and is a fan of proper formatting. He wants everyone to write their discussion posts in markdown format.
- Jake would like the application to automatically tag posts with the location from which they are written (He does not want his friends to have to enter their location).

## Tips

Your friend recently completed WDI and last week you ran into her at Neo-Folk/House fusion show in Bushwick. Over the loud basslines and banjo twangs, you mention the app Jake wants made.

- "I've actually done something with markdown fomrmatting. I think I used a library called [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)"
- "Well, if you have the IP of the person making the HTTP request to create a comment, can't you use the [IPInfo API](http://ipinfo.io/) to get location?"
