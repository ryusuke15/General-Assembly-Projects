# Project One

**Build a web-based, CRUD application.**

## Objectives

1. Build confidence as a developer by building something of your own.
-  Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work.
-  Gain experience building a complex application.
-  Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner.
-  Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting.

## Dates

* *Start* - Morning of Wednesday, April 15.
* *End* - 9:00AM on Tuesday, April 21

On the morning of the 21st, we will each present a 5 minute lightning talk to our classmates the progress we have made.

## Process

Just like we've been practicing in class, we do not want to jump immediately into coding. We want to carefully plan our apporach.

1. Create a Trello board with `Backlog`, `Doing`, and `Done` lists.
- Collect user stories from the spec of your choice and enter them into the `Backlog` list.
- Write an ERD
  * Attach this to your ERD card in Trello
- Wireframes - detail the flow of your app through simple wireframes
  * Attach these to Trello cards
  * You can choose whether you want to whiteboard the wireframes or use some program.
- Routes - design the HTTP route architecture of your app
- Iterative Development
  * Move one story at a time into the `Doing` list. Once it's done, move it to `Done` and start your next story.
  * **DO NOT** try to work on more than one or two stories at once.

## Spec & ERD

As always, please create a simple feature spec for this app.

Format is as follows:

> 1. A user can....

> A WIREFRAME - ie, what will this feature 'look' like as a rendered HTML page.

You will also want to create an ERD for this application **based on the spec** that you create. 

## Deliverables

* Public repo on Github with your project code
* `README.md` (in the root folder of your project) that includes:
  * The project's name and description,
  * Your feature spec with links to pictures of your wireframes
  * A representation of your ERD - a picture of a whiteboard drawing will work just fine here
  * APIs or modules used and descriptions of each
  * Instructions for downloading the code and running it on localhost
  * Link to the live url of your hosted project...
* A deployed application on a Digital Ocean droplet
* A 5-minute lightning talk to discuss the below 3 topics
  * What did you do?
  * What was the biggest thing you learned?
  * What was the hardest part of the project?

## Instructors

As this project is mostly self-driven we expect you to spend a lot of time debugging errors and problem solving on your own. That said, we want to schedule 1:1 with each of you to review your progress and give feedback.

Each student will be able to sign up for 2 45 minute pair programming sessions with an instructor. Please [sign up for a slot](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/spreadsheets/d/1TJEcMNfBAbRX9y-frvNErpqYD_jtODD7Ilj8p3ZBfic/edit#gid=0).

Please keep in mind that we will not be able to maintain a help queue a la Sean Jackson, so if you grab us outside of your scheduled time please understand if we are not able to answer your questions.

## Keep in Mind

**You are going to encounter a ton of unexpected errors and problems.**

Expect to come up against a lot of what can *seem* like roadblocks. Resist the urge to get frustrated. These are amazing learning opportunities. A lot of students treat errors during projects as just getting in the way of "finishing". The point of this project is **not** to finish all of the user stories; the point is to integrate your knowledge and deepen your understanding of how to put apps together.

Errors often provide the most valuable source of information about what we don't yet understand. Seeing an error as "it's not working" and randomly changing stuff until "it works" won't teach you anything. Spending time thoughtfully debugging issues is a fantastic investment that will lead to greater mastery and understanding.

**Pro-Tip** - 'Failure is a temporary state.'
