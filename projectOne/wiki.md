# Wiki

## Problem

Henrietta is a business magnate and wants to create a internally facing wiki for her organization. She wants her employees to be able to write articles in order to inform colleagues about their insights.

## Requirements

- All articles should be editable - this is a collaborative workplace!
- All articles should display an author so that anyone who has questions about the contents of an article can contact the author
- If an article is changed, the time of that change should be shown so that users can know how up to date an article is
- Henrietta wants the articles to be written in markdown so that the content is visually appealing
- In order to keep users engaged, Henrietta would like a user to receive an email when an article that they've published is edited.
- Henrietta wants users to be able to add a category to an article so that articles can be organized

## Tips

Disavowing pizza and red bull, the stereotypical food choice of developers, you have decided to explore New York City's salad offerings.

- While browsing your favorite salad blog, you saw an ad for a service called [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/Code_Examples/nodejs.html). You accidentally clicked the banner, but upon seeing the website you realize this may be very helpful for the wiki you are working on.
- While at Chopt, you overheard two developers chatting about how  [marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked) is a great node library for rendering markdown.
